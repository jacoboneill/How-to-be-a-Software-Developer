Java has primitive types and reference types. The main four primitive type categories in Java are: integer, decimal, boolean and character

## Integer
The integer category has the most primitive types. They include: `byte`, `short`, `int` and `long`

### byte
The byte type is used for numbers that are between -128 to 127, which is the same as 8 bits (1 byte) using twos complement for the negative numbers
```java
byte aSingleByte = 127;
```

### short
The short type is used for numbers between -32,768 and 32,767.
```java
short aSmallNumber = 32767;
```

### int
The int type (the most common type for numbers) is named after integer. This type can go from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
```java
int anInteger = 2147483647;
```

### long
The long type is used if you need a number over 2,147,483,647. The number has to be appended by a *'L'* and can go from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
```java
long aLargeNumber = 9223372036854775807L;
```
